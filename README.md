# pH7 WebApp Boilerplate

A Powerful, Modern and Lightweight PHP 7.1+ Boilerplate to build quickly robust web apps or small/medium SaaS.


## The Problem

It is always tough to directly start a new "clean-code" project from scratch based on good programming principles.
We always need to think about the best architecture/patterns for the project and spending time looking for the good libraries.


## The Solution

**pH7 Boilerplate** gives the best coding practices for you, with already everything setup (.gitignore, .htaccess, composer file), the project already configured (for [Silex](https://silex.sensiolabs.org) and [Twig](https://twig.sensiolabs.org) and has all the good/useful libraries included that will make your new web app the best!


**Simply clone it, and start developing your great web app!**
