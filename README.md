# pH7 WebApp Boilerplate

A Powerful, Modern and Lightweight PHP 7.1+ Boilerplate to build fastly robust web apps or small/medium SaaS.


## The Problem

It is always tough to directly start a new "clean-code" project from scratch based on good programming principles. 
We always need to think about the best architecture/patterns for the project and look for good libraries.


## The Solution

**pH7 Boilerplate** gives the best coding practices for you, with already everything setted up (.gitignore, .htaccess, composer file) and the project already configured (for [Silex](https://silex.sensiolabs.org) and [Twig](https://twig.sensiolabs.org).


**Simply clone it, and start developing your great web app!**
